## Project Checkpoints

- The navbar and the user form
- The meal plan and the recipe section
- Daily Calorie Calculation and Meal Plan Generation.
- Fetching and displaying of recipes.

- **Step-1**: Create Api Key
    - Create an account in [https://spoonacular.com/food-api](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) and get the api key which you would use in the project.
    - **Step-2**: Nav bar
    - The website should have a `navigation` section.
    - The `nav` bar should have the logo of your website
    - **Step-3**: User Form
    - This `user-form` will be used to take user data and calculate the daily calorie requirement of the user.
    - The form should have five input fields, `weight`(kg), `height`(cm), `age`, `gender` and `physical activity` level. The `physical activity` should have three options, `light, moderate and active.`
    - The form should have a `submit` button
- **Step-4**: Meal Plan
    - The meal-plan section would have 3 meal cards, for breakfast, lunch and dinner respectively.
    - Each of the meal cards should have the following: `meal image`, `meal name`, `calories` of the meal and a `get-recipe` button.
- **Step-5**: Recipe
    - The recipe section should have 3 tabs - `Ingredients`, `steps` and `Equipment`.
    - The ingredients tab would display the list of ingredients along with their quantity required for the recipe.
    - The equipment tab displays a list of equipment needed for the recipe.
    - The steps tab would display a ordered list of steps that need to be followed.
- **Step-6**: Daily Calorie Requirement
    - On clicking the user form submit button, take all the inputs from the user form and calculate the BMR of the user. The formula for BMR is
        
        **For women**, BMR = 655.1 + (9.563 x weight in kg) + (1.850 x height in cm) - (4.676 x age in years)
        
        **For men**, BMR = 66.47 + (13.75 x weight in kg) + (5.003 x height in cm) - (6.755 x age in years)
        
    - Calculate the daily calorie requirement from the BMR. The formula varies for different levels of activity level.
        - **Lightly active (exercise 1–3 days/week)**: BMR x 1.375
        - **Moderately active (exercise 3–5 days/week)**: BMR x 1.55
        - **Active (exercise 6–7 days/week)**: BMR x 1.725
- **Step-7**: Generate Meal Plan
    - Once the daily calorie requirement is calculated, use the spoonacular api ([https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Generate-Meal-Plan](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Generate-Meal-Plan)) to **generate a** **new meal plan**. The api would return three meals each for **breakfast, lunch and dinne**r.
    - Populate the `meal-plan` section with the data received from the api.
    - The `meal-plan` section should be displayed only after the meal plan is generated from the daily calorie requirement.
- **Step 8**: Generate Recipe
    - When the user clicks on the `get-recipe` button on one of the meals in the meal plan, use the `id` of that meal to fetch its recipe from the api ([https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Get-Recipe-Information](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Get-Recipe-Information) )
    - Use the **data** received from the api to populate all the three tabs of the recipe section.
    - The `recipe-section` should only be displayed once the data is fetched from the api.
